# Fire Spotting

Fire spotting is the ignition of new fires ahead of the main front by
wind-carried embers. PROPAGATOR launches embers from burning, spotting-prone
cells, transports them downwind, and tracks where they are generated and where
they land in every realization.

## Enabling Spotting

Spotting is controlled by two switches:

1. **The simulation flag.** Set `"do_spotting": true` in the JSON
   configuration (CLI runs), or pass `do_spotting=True` when constructing the
   `Propagator` programmatically. When the flag is off, spotting is disabled
   for every fuel regardless of the fuel definitions.
2. **The per-fuel flag.** Each fuel type in the fuel system declares whether
   it is prone to spotting. In YAML fuel definitions this is the optional
   `spotting: true` attribute; the legacy fuel system enables it for the
   `conifers` fuel only. Fuels can also tune the ignition probability of
   landing embers with the `prob_ign_by_embers` attribute. Only burning cells
   whose fuel has `spotting: true` can launch embers.

```python
from propagator.core import FUEL_SYSTEM_LEGACY, Propagator

sim = Propagator(
    dem=dem,
    veg=veg,
    fuels=FUEL_SYSTEM_LEGACY,
    do_spotting=True,
    realizations=100,
)
```

## Model

When a spotting-prone cell burns, it emits a Poisson-distributed number of
embers (mean `LAMBDA_SPOTTING = {{spotting.LAMBDA}}`). Each ember is thrown at a
uniformly random azimuth `θ`, lands some distance away, and — if it clears the
landing-cell checks — ignites a new fire after a delay. The landing distance is
the heart of the model and is documented in full below.

### Landing distance

Each ember's landing distance is drawn from a **lognormal distribution** whose
median scales with wind speed and with the source cell's fireline intensity,
and is concentrated downwind:

```text
alignment    = cos(w_dir − θ)
d_median     = DISTANCE_REF · (U / WIND_REF) · (I / FLI_REF)^FLI_EXP
directional  = exp( ANISOTROPY · (alignment − 1) )
distance     = LogNormal( ln(d_median · directional), LOG_SIGMA )
landing_time = distance / ( U · max(alignment, MIN_ALIGNMENT) )    # seconds
```

with `θ` the ember's trajectory angle (uniform in `[0, 2π)`), `U` the source
cell's wind speed, and `I` the source cell's fireline intensity (kW/m, carried
on the propagation front from when the source cell ignited). If `U ≤ 0` or
`I ≤ 0` the ember travels no distance (no transport medium / no fire to loft
it). The model lives in `fire_spotting` / `compute_spotting` in
`propagator.core.numba.propagation`.

Reference values (the values below are injected from the code at docs-build
time, so they always match the running constants):

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD060 -->
| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SPOTTING_DISTANCE_REF` | {{spotting.DISTANCE_REF}} m | median landing distance at the reference state |
| `SPOTTING_WIND_REF` | {{spotting.WIND_REF}} km/h | reference wind speed |
| `SPOTTING_FLI_REF` | {{spotting.FLI_REF}} kW/m | reference fireline intensity |
| `SPOTTING_FLI_EXPONENT` | {{spotting.FLI_EXPONENT}} | intensity → distance exponent (see below) |
| `SPOTTING_ANISOTROPY` | {{spotting.ANISOTROPY}} | downwind concentration (shape only) |
| `SPOTTING_DISTANCE_LOG_SIGMA` | {{spotting.LOG_SIGMA}} | lognormal spread of the landing distance |
| `SPOTTING_MIN_ALIGNMENT` | {{spotting.MIN_ALIGNMENT}} | floor on the along-wind fraction for travel time |
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD060 -->

At the reference state (`U = {{spotting.WIND_REF}} km/h`,
`I = {{spotting.FLI_REF}} kW/m`) the median landing distance is exactly
`DISTANCE_REF = {{spotting.DISTANCE_REF}} m`.

The figure below shows how the median landing distance grows with wind speed
(linearly) and with fireline intensity, and how it is concentrated downwind.
Embers whose distance falls below `2·cellsize` are filtered out and behave like
ordinary contact spread, so at light winds no long-range spotting occurs.

concentration](img/spotting_distance.png)

Because the distance is *sampled* from a lognormal, each panel above is only
the median; individual embers scatter around it, with a right-skewed tail that
occasionally seeds distant spot fires:

intensity combinations](img/spotting_distribution.png)

### Landing and ignition

Once the landing cell is chosen it must pass a few checks before a spot fire is
scheduled:

- the cell must be in-grid, not already burning, and not a `NO_FUEL` cell;
- ignition succeeds with probability `P_c = P_C0 · (1 + prob_ign_by_embers)`
  (`P_C0 = {{spotting.P_C0}}`), i.e. a constant base probability corrected by
  the receiving cell's vegetation.

Ignition is **not instantaneous**. Once an ember successfully ignites a cell,
the model adds a **delay before the spot fire becomes capable of propagation**,
sampled from a lognormal distribution (median {{spotting.TTP_MEDIAN}} s), and
added to the ember travel time. The cell only starts spreading — and only counts
as a received-ember ignition — once this combined time has elapsed.

## Rationale for the non-obvious parametrizations

This formulation replaces an earlier Alexandridis-style distance formula
(`distance = r_n · exp(U · k · (cos Δθ − 1))` with `r_n ~ N(100 m, 25 m)`). That
form had a wind-*independent* ~100 m base that the exponential could only
attenuate, and it scaled the anisotropy by wind speed — so at low wind the
directional term collapsed and embers landed ~100 m away **isotropically**,
producing strong omnidirectional spotting even at 0.1 km/h. The current model
puts the wind dependence in the distance **magnitude** instead.

### 1. Median linear in wind speed — `(U / WIND_REF)`

Embers are transported horizontally by the wind, so their travel distance must
grow with wind speed and **vanish as the wind dies**. Making the median
proportional to `U` gives exactly that: at `U → 0`, `d_median → 0`
*continuously*, and every ember falls inside `2·cellsize` and is filtered out.
Spotting becomes a genuinely wind-driven phenomenon. With the legacy conifer
fuel (`I ≈ {{spotting.CONIFER_I}} kW/m`) the median landing distance is
≈ {{spotting.DIST_50}} m at 50 km/h but only ≈ {{spotting.DIST_5}} m at 5 km/h
(below the `2·cellsize = {{spotting.FILTER}} m` filter for {{spotting.CELLSIZE}} m
cells), and ≈ {{spotting.DIST_01}} m at 0.1 km/h — so all spotting disappears at
0.1 km/h while long-range spotting survives in strong wind.

### 2. Intensity exponent of 1/3 — `(I / FLI_REF)^(1/3)`

Stronger fires loft embers higher, and higher embers ride the wind for longer
before landing. Two physically-motivated steps chain into the 1/3 exponent:

- **Loft height ∝ I^(2/3).** The buoyant-plume length scale of a line fire (the
  height to which the convective column carries firebrands) scales as
  `H ∝ I^(2/3)` — the standard Byram/plume result also used to define the Froude
  number in the fire-spotting literature (Sardoy et al. 2008; Kaur et al. 2019).
- **Distance ∝ U·√H** (ballistic advection). An ember released at height `H`
  into a horizontal wind `U` travels a downwind distance proportional to
  `U · √(H/g)` (free-fall time `√(2H/g)` × horizontal speed `U`).

Chaining them: `d ∝ U · √H ∝ U · √(I^(2/3)) = U · I^(1/3)`. The dependence on
intensity is deliberately weak — a 10× more intense fire spots only
~{{spotting.INTENSITY_10X}}× farther — which matches the observation that wind,
not intensity, is the dominant control on spotting range.

Because the median uses the **source cell's** fireline intensity, a freshly
seeded ignition (which carries `I = 0` until the fire develops) emits no embers
on its first burn step; spotting begins once the fire has spread and real
fireline intensities are established. This is intentional: an incipient
ignition point is not a developed fire capable of lofting firebrands.

### 3. Anisotropy decoupled from wind speed — `ANISOTROPY · (cos Δθ − 1)`

Firebrand landing is concentrated **downwind** (Sardoy et al. found a downwind
lognormal and a crosswind normal). We keep a downwind-concentration factor,
but — crucially — its strength `ANISOTROPY` is a **pure shape constant**, not
multiplied by `U`. This is the direct fix for the isotropy problem above: the
downwind bias is always present, independent of wind magnitude, so the model
never degenerates into an isotropic spray at low wind. With
`ANISOTROPY = {{spotting.ANISOTROPY}}`, an ember thrown directly upwind
(`Δθ = π`) has its median scaled by `exp(−2·ANISOTROPY) ≈ {{spotting.UPWIND_FACTOR}}`,
i.e. it lands ~{{spotting.UPWIND_RATIO}}× closer than a downwind ember — the
lobes in panel (b) above.

### 4. Lognormal landing distance — `LogNormal(ln(median), LOG_SIGMA)`

Sardoy et al. (2008) showed, from CFD/combustion simulations of line fires,
that short-range firebrand landing distances (up to ~1 km) are **lognormally
distributed** in the downwind direction. The lognormal is strictly positive and
right-skewed, so it naturally produces occasional long-range embers (the heavy
tail that seeds distant spot fires) while keeping the bulk near the median.
`LOG_SIGMA = {{spotting.LOG_SIGMA}}` gives a moderately broad spread (the
5th–95th percentiles span roughly `{{spotting.LOG_P05}}×` to `{{spotting.LOG_P95}}×`
the median) without an unrealistically fat tail.

### 5. Direction-aware landing time — `distance / (U · max(cos Δθ, MIN_ALIGNMENT))`

The flight time is the landing distance divided by the horizontal transport
speed *along the ember's own trajectory*. Wind blows at speed `U` in direction
`w_dir`, so the component that carries an ember heading at angle `θ` is
`U · cos(w_dir − θ)` — the along-trajectory projection, not the full wind
magnitude. Downwind embers (`cos ≈ 1`) are carried at nearly full wind speed;
off-axis embers move downrange more slowly and take longer to land. The
projection is floored at `SPOTTING_MIN_ALIGNMENT = {{spotting.MIN_ALIGNMENT}}` to
remove the `cos → 0` singularity for near-crosswind embers and to prevent
implausibly long flight times; because the `directional` factor and the
`2·cellsize` filter already suppress off-axis throws, this floor affects only a
small tail of embers.

## Calibration and tuning

All behaviour is controlled by the reference constants. To recalibrate:

- **Overall reach:** `SPOTTING_DISTANCE_REF` (linear scaling of all distances).
- **Which wind counts as "strong":** `SPOTTING_WIND_REF` — the wind speed at
  which the median equals `DISTANCE_REF`.
- **Sensitivity to fire intensity:** `SPOTTING_FLI_REF` (pivot) and
  `SPOTTING_FLI_EXPONENT` (steepness).
- **Downwind focus:** `SPOTTING_ANISOTROPY` (larger → tighter downwind cone).
- **Tail heaviness / variability:** `SPOTTING_DISTANCE_LOG_SIGMA`.
- **Off-axis travel time:** `SPOTTING_MIN_ALIGNMENT` (floor on the along-wind
  speed fraction; smaller → longer flight times for near-crosswind embers).

## Outputs

When spotting is enabled, two additional per-cell fields are tracked per
realization and aggregated in every `PropagatorOutput` snapshot (and written
as GeoTIFFs by the CLI):

- `spotting_generation_probability` — fraction of realizations in which the
  cell launched at least one ember.
- `spotting_receiving_probability` — fraction of realizations in which the
  cell was hit by an ember.

These let you separate fire spread driven by surface contagion from spread
driven by ember transport. See [Simulation Outputs](outputs.md) for the full
list of output fields.
